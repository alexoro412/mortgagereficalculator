# Mortgage Refinance Calculator<sup>BETA</sup>

A modern, responsive web application for calculating whether you should refinance your mortgage. Built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, this calculator helps you make informed decisions about mortgage refinancing by comparing your current mortgage against potential refinance options.

This is basically entirely vibecoded with Claude, and I got most of the math from my friend. None of us are experts. You should check with a financial advisor before deciding to refinance your mortgage.
